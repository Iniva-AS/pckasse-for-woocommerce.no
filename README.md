# PCKasse for WooCommerce

The official website for [PCKasse for WooCommerce](https://pckasse-for-woocommerce.no).

To be even more transparent we have decided to make the source code of our
website public. This gives the curious reader the possibility to look into how
it's made. Life is just a bit more fun when you are open and transparent ðŸ•º

## About

PCKasse for WooCommerce is a sync that stands between WooCommerce and PCKasse.
This makes it possible for you to have your own WooCommerce store (not the multisite
solution from PCKasse) and have it synchronized with your PCKasse.

We already have three clients using this system, and it's working really well!

Built by [Iniva AS](https://iniva.no), a small Norwegian company working on
building products with and for clients.
